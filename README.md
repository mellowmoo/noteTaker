# Note Taker
Welcome to my note taking app.  For this project, I wanted to create a note taking app that uses local storage to save notes.  This app was built using node js and relavant packages.  It parses user input into json format in order to save notes and will parse the json notes so that they can be displayed on the front end to the user.

## Usage
Once you open the app, you can enter notes by clicking the button to get started.  You can write the title for notes in the title section, then write the body in the section that is below it.

### How To Run
After forking the repository, you want to make sure node is installed on your device.
1. Within the terminal for the repo you want to run an npm install.
```
npm install
```
2. Start the server using the npm start command.
```
npm start
```
3. Go to the browser and use the app.  By default it should be running on `port 3001`.
